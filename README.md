# myFirstSynapticJs_ML_App

The idea was simple, I just wanted to make an API powered by Machine Learining alorithms which will give a gender as response for given name.
I used the Node.js to make this thing along with synaptic js library.and Perceptron Algorithm.
I found the training data online and just modiefied it, you can check it inside the users controller in routes folder.
you can modify the data in order to achieve more accurate perception.



HOW TO RUN

1>get the repo
2>$ DEBUG=myapp:* npm start  //to run the node project


....  WAIT UNTIL THE ML WORKS 
afer starting port you can go to respective port 

4>http://localhost:3000/users/your-name

5>This will print the response on screen_ as male or female 

How it works--- it will be on my blog soon, wait for it_
